# DOS8_template_for_HamsterCMS
MS DOS appearance template for HamsterCMS without Bootstrap (386) simple clean code

HTML template with a design similar to DOS programs

layout adapted for Hamster CMS
also works on  http://web1.0hosting.net/ hosting
but you can use this template as a normal html template

https://github.com/turboblack/HamsterCMS world's smallest and very simple multi-template flatfile content management system 

this template is special in that it does not have any graphics, it is made exclusively of text symbols

in the template there is a cursor specifically for viewing dark pages, and above the navigation bar 
there is a special thing to show which page you are on at a given time

HTML template made in the form of MS DOS programs

Great for an old school project

To use a template, create an **dos** folder in the **templates** folder, copy **index.html** there, open the admin panel on the hosting, select the page, and specify this template in the options.

This is what this template looks like

I invite you to visit the hosting that runs on this CMS
